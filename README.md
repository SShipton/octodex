In our Octodex assignment, we learned how use HTML and CSS to recreate the popular website, Octodex, using flexbox and grids.

When the page is open on a large screen, like a desktop, the Octocats stretch all the way across. But, when you shrink the page down, or when you're on mobile, the Octocats reformat themselves into a pattern that closer resembles colums, so that you can still see all of the cats without having to scroll left to right!
